<h3>Forest Gump</h3>
<p>This came out the year I was born and I love Tom Hanks portrayal of the one and only Forest, Forest Gump.</p>

<h3>Toy Story</h3>
<p>The toys are indeed alive. Great classic and I have original Buzz and Woody toys! Coincidently, Tom Hanks is here again. Hmmmm...</p>

<h3>Avengers 2012</h3>
<p>Easy to go back and watch and was the beginning of my childhood nerdom on the bug screen for years to come. Tom Hanks, yet to be seen.</p>
