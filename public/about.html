<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>First thing I would want anyone to know about me is that I am a believer, follower, and lover of Jesus Christ. My life has
  forever been changed by him and I thank him for everything. As for the person who wrote this, Chris is a proud
  native of Decatur,GA. Happily married and a father as of the end of 2023. He loves his family and believes his skills
  exist to make their lives and people around them better.</p>

<p>As for background, there's several stops we have to make. Originally studied to be an engineer at Georgia Tech and 
  graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering. Worked as an engineer for a while then took a complete career shift
  to follow a passion earlier than expected. Decided to jump into education for 4 years at my old high school teaching
  math, coaching softball, mentoring, and developing some truly amazing relationships with students and colleauges. Once
  we had our first child, it was time to make a move that let me pour the same energy to him as I did my students. So I
  jumped back into the STEM world.</p>
  
<p>Now I am at a place whatever I do, I want it to present a reasonable challenge while still providing for my family. I've
  realized that my skills allow me to be solution-oriented and creative but now I want to channel those parts of me into
  something that I can see myself doing everyday. I find myself in the IT/Web Dev space and look forward to each new
  opportunity that comes my way.</p>

<p>Lastly, here are a few quick fun things you should know about me.
